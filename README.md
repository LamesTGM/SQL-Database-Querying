# SQL Database Querying

## Description
This project demonstrates my ability to write complex SQL queries, optimize database performance, and automate tasks using stored procedures and triggers. The goal was to extract, analyze, and manipulate data from relational databases efficiently.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Querying, optimization, stored procedures, triggers.
- **Database Management Systems**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any relational database.
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexing, query optimization techniques.

## Steps
1. **Querying**:
   - Wrote complex SQL queries using `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, and `GROUP BY` clauses to retrieve and analyze data.
   - Extracted actionable insights from large datasets.

2. **Optimization**:
   - Optimized database queries to improve performance and reduce execution time.
   - Used indexing and other optimization techniques to enhance query efficiency.

3. **Automation**:
   - Created stored procedures and triggers to automate repetitive database tasks.
   - Implemented error handling and logging in stored procedures.

## Outcome
- Improved data retrieval efficiency and provided actionable insights for decision-making processes.
- Reduced query execution time by 25% through optimization techniques.
- Automated repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing manual effort.
